# Supervised Machine Learning: Theory & Practical  

This repository contains a comprehensive study of **Supervised Machine Learning**, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. It includes detailed explanations and code for about **15 fundamental theorems** in machine learning, along with a real-world project on **Heart Disease Prediction**.

## 📌 Repository Overview  

This repository is designed for **students, researchers, and professionals** who want to strengthen their understanding of supervised learning through a structured approach that includes:  

- 📖 **Detailed Theory**: Mathematical and conceptual explanations of key supervised learning theorems.  
- 💻 **Practical Implementation**: Code examples to apply theoretical concepts to real datasets.  
- 📊 **Heart Disease Prediction Project**: End-to-end implementation of a predictive model using machine learning techniques.  

### 🔢 Supervised Machine Learning Theorems  

This section includes **18 theorems** fundamental to machine learning, with detailed explanations and Python implementations. The key topics covered include:  

- **Bayes’ Theorem**  
- **Naïve Bayes Classifier**  
- **Linear Regression & Its Assumptions**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Trees & Entropy**  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
- **Overfitting & Underfitting**  
- **And many more...**  

Each theorem is implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks** with **step-by-step explanations, equations, and code examples** using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

### 🏥 Heart Disease Prediction Project
