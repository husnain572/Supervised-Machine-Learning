# Supervised Machine Learning: Theory & Practical  

This repository contains a comprehensive study of **Supervised Machine Learning**, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. It includes detailed explanations and code for about **15 fundamental theorems** in machine learning, along with a real-world project on **Heart Disease Prediction**.

## Repository Overview  

This repository is designed for **students, researchers, and professionals** who want to strengthen their understanding of supervised learning through a structured approach that includes:  

- **Detailed Theory**: Mathematical and conceptual explanations of key supervised learning theorems.  
- **Practical Implementation**: Code examples to apply theoretical concepts to real datasets.  
- **Heart Disease Prediction Project**: End-to-end implementation of a predictive model using machine learning techniques.  

### Supervised Machine Learning Theorems  

This section includes **18 theorems** fundamental to machine learning, with detailed explanations and Python implementations. The key topics covered include:  

- **Bayes’ Theorem**  
- **Naïve Bayes Classifier**  
- **Linear Regression & Its Assumptions**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Trees & Entropy**  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
- **Overfitting & Underfitting**  
- **And many more...**  

Each theorem is implemented in **Jupyter Notebooks** with **step-by-step explanations, equations, and code examples** using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

### Heart Disease Prediction Project  

This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict **heart disease risk** based on clinical parameters. It covers:  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
2. **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing**  
3. **Model Selection (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)**  
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Evaluation**  
5. **Results & Insights**
