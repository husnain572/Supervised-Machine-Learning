It is primarily employed to **predict categorical dependent variables** based on a set of independent variables. Unlike regression tasks, logistic regression is specifically designed for **classification problems**, where the output is a discrete or categorical value, such as **Yes/No, 0/1, or True/False**. Instead of providing exact binary outputs, logistic regression outputs **probabilistic values** that range between **0 and 1**.  \n","\n","While logistic regression shares some similarities with **linear regression**, their applications differ.  \n","- **Linear regression** is used for predicting **continuous values** in regression problems.  \n","- **Logistic regression** is applied to **classification tasks**.  \n","\n","In logistic regression, an **\"S\"-shaped logistic function** (also known as the **sigmoid function**) is fitted to the data, predicting two distinct outcomes (**0 or 1**). This curve represents the **likelihood of an event**, such as determining whether cells are cancerous or if a mouse is obese based on its weight.  \n","\n","One of the key strengths of logistic regression is its ability to **provide probabilities** and classify new data using both **continuous and discrete datasets**. It can effectively **identify the most influential variables** for classification and handle various types of data.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function)**  \n","\n","The **sigmoid function** is a mathematical tool used to **map predicted values to probabilities**. It transforms any real-valued input into a value **between 0 and 1**, ensuring the output remains within these bounds. This transformation results in an **\"S\"-shaped curve**, which is why it is called the **sigmoid** or **logistic function**.  \n","\n","In logistic regression, a **threshold value** is used to determine the classification outcome:  \n","- Values **above** the threshold are assigned to **1**.  \n","- Values **below** the threshold are assigned to **0**.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Assumptions for Logistic Regression**  \n","1. The **dependent variable** must be **categorical**.  \n","2. The **independent variables** should not exhibit **multi-collinearity**.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Logistic Regression Equation**  \n","\n","The **logistic regression equation** is derived from the **linear regression equation**. While **linear regression** predicts continuous values, logistic regression **restricts** the output to values **between 0 and 1**. The equation is transformed using the **sigmoid function** to achieve this.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **Types of Logistic Regression**  \n","\n","Logistic regression can be categorized into three types based on the nature of the **dependent variable**:  \n","\n","1. **Binomial**:  \n","   - Involves **two possible outcomes** for the dependent variable, such as **0/1, Pass/Fail, Yes/No**.  \n","\n","2. **Multinomial**:  \n","   - Deals with **three or more unordered categories**, such as **\"cat,\" \"dog,\" or \"sheep.\"**  \n","\n","3. **Ordinal**:  \n","   - Handles **three or more ordered categories**, such as **\"low,\" \"medium,\" or \"high.\"**  \n","\n","---\n","\n","Logistic regression is a **powerful tool** in machine learning due to its ability to handle **classification tasks effectively** while providing **interpretable probabilistic outputs**.
