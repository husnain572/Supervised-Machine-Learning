Continue until no further classification is possible, and the final node is called a leaf node.\n","\n","### Example: Deciding What to Wear Based on Weather\n","1. **Start at the root node**: Check the weather.\n","   - **Is it raining?**\n","     - **Yes**:\n","       - **Do you have a raincoat?**\n","         - **Yes**: Wear your raincoat.\n","         - **No**: Take an umbrella.\n","     - **No**:\n","       - **Is it cold?**\n","         - **Yes**: Wear a jacket.\n","         - **No**: Wear light, comfortable clothing.\n","\n","## When to Use Decision Trees\n","- **Interpretability**: Easy to understand and visualize.\n","- **Mixed Data**: Data contains both categorical and numerical features.\n","- **Non-linear Relationships**: Features and target have non-linear relationships.\n","- **Handling Missing Values**: Decision trees can handle missing values.\n","- **Outliers**: Minimal impact of outliers on the model.\n","- **Classification and Regression**: Suitable for both tasks.\n","- **Automatic Feature Selection**: Desired in the model.\n","- **Small to Medium-sized Datasets**: Ideal for such datasets.\n","\n","## Pre-requisites for Decision Tree Algorithm\n","1. **Well-structured Dataset**: Should not have missing values.\n","2. **Relevant Features**: Works best with relevant features.\n","3. **Classification Problem**: Target variable should have categorical or binary outcomes.\n","4. **Regression Problem**: Target variable should be continuous.\n","5. **High Dimensional Data**: Preprocessing or ensemble methods may be required.\n","\n","## Attribute Selection Measures\n","- **Attribute Selection Measure (ASM)**: Technique to select the best attribute for nodes.\n","- **Popular Techniques**:\n","  - **Information Gain**\n","  - **Gini Index**\n","\n","### 1. Entropy\n","- **What It Measures**: Entropy measures the uncertainty or randomness in the dataset.\n","- **Role in Decision Trees**: Used to calculate Information Gain. The goal is to reduce entropy by splitting the data, creating purer subsets.\n","\n","### 2. Information Gain\n","- **What It Measures**: Information Gain (IG) measures the reduction in entropy after a dataset is split on a feature.\n","- **Role in Decision Trees**: Used to choose the feature that provides the maximum reduction in entropy. Higher IG indicates a better split.\n","\n","### 3. Gini Impurity\n","- **What It Measures**: Gini Impurity measures the probability of misclassification if we randomly assign a label to an item in the dataset.\n","- **Role in Decision Trees**: Used in CART to determine the best feature to split the data. The algorithm selects the feature that minimizes Gini Impurity.\n","\n","## Pruning: Getting an Optimal Decision Tree\n","- **Pruning**: Process of deleting unnecessary nodes to get the optimal decision tree.\n","- **Purpose**: A too-large tree increases the risk of overfitting, while a small tree may not capture all important features.\n","- **Types of Pruning**:\n","  - **Cost Complexity Pruning**\n","  - **Reduced Error Pruning**\n","\n","## Advantages of Decision Trees\n","- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand, mimicking human decision-making.\n","- **Usefulness**: Effective for solving decision-related problems.\n","- **Outcome Analysis**: Helps in considering all possible outcomes for a problem.\n","- **Data Cleaning**: Requires less data cleaning compared to other algorithms.\n","\n","## Disadvantages of Decision Trees\n","- **Complexity**: Contains many layers, making it complex.\n","- **Overfitting**: May have overfitting issues, which can be resolved using the **Random Forest algorithm**.\n","- **Computational Complexity**: Increases with more class labels."],"metadata":{"id":"vX75m2xvRMWE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"tA8rFWYcL57v","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738000382123,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":15657,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad
