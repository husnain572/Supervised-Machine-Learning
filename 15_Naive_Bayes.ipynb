It is based on **Bayes' Theorem** and is called **\"naive\"** because it assumes that all features (input variables) are **independent** of each other (even though this may not be true in practice). Let's break it down step by step:\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 1. **What is Bayes' Theorem?**\n","Bayes' Theorem is a way to calculate probabilities. The formula is:\n","\n","$$\n","P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","- **\\(P(A|B)\\)**: Probability of event A given that B has already occurred (Posterior Probability).\n","- **\\(P(B|A)\\)**: Probability of event B given that A has already occurred (Likelihood).\n","- **\\(P(A)\\)**: Probability of event A (Prior Probability).\n","- **\\(P(B)\\)**: Probability of event B (Marginal Probability).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 2. **How Does Naive Bayes Work?**\n","Naive Bayes is used for classification. For example, if we want to predict whether an email is **spam** or **not spam**, Naive Bayes works as follows:\n","\n","### Training Phase:\n","- Calculate probabilities from the dataset, such as:\n","- **$P(\\text{Spam})$**: Probability that an email is spam.  \n","- **$P(\\text{Not Spam})$**: Probability that an email is not spam.  \n","- **$P(\\text{Word}_i|\\text{Spam})$**: Probability that a specific word appears in an email if it is spam.  \n","- **$P(\\text{Word}_i|\\text{Not Spam})$**: Probability that a specific word appears in an email if it is not spam.  \n","\n","\n","### Testing Phase:\n","- For a new email, the algorithm calculates:\n","- **$P(\\text{Spam}|\\text{Email})$**: Probability that the email is spam.  \n","- **$P(\\text{Not Spam}|\\text{Email})$**: Probability that the email is not spam.  \n","\n","- The final prediction is based on the higher probability.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 3. **Why is Naive Bayes \"Naive\"?**\n","- The algorithm assumes that all features (words in an email) are **independent** of each other. This means the probability of one word does not depend on the presence of another word.\n","- Example: If an email contains the words \"free\" and \"offer,\" Naive Bayes treats them as independent, even though in reality, these words together might increase the likelihood of the email being spam.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 4. **Types of Naive Bayes**\n","1. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Used for continuous data.\n","2. **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: Used for discrete data (e.g., word counts).\n","3. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Used for binary data (0 or 1).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 5. **Example: Spam Detection**\n","### Training Data:\n","- Total emails: 100\n","- Spam emails: 30\n","- Not spam emails: 70\n","- Probability of the word \"free\" in spam emails:\n","$$P(\\text{free}|\\text{Spam}) = 0.6$$\n","\n","- Probability of the word \"free\" in not spam emails:\n","$$P(\\text{free}|\\text{Not Spam}) = 0.1$$\n","\n","\n","### New Email: \"Get free money now\"\n","- Calculate:\n","$$P(\\text{Spam}|\\text{free}) = \\frac{P(\\text{free}|\\text{Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Spam})}{P(\\text{free})}$$\n","\n","$$P(\\text{Not Spam}|\\text{free}) = \\frac{P(\\text{free}|\\text{Not Spam}) \\cdot P(\\text{Not Spam})}{P(\\text{free})}$$\n","\n","If **P(Spam|free)** is higher, classify the email as spam.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 6. **Advantages of Naive Bayes**\n","- Simple and fast.\n","- Works well with small datasets.\n","- Effective for high-dimensional data (e.g., text data).\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 7. **Disadvantages of Naive Bayes**\n","- Assumes features are independent, which may not be true in real-world scenarios.\n","- If a feature is not present in the training data, its probability becomes 0, which can reduce accuracy.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## 8. **Real-Life Applications**\n","- Spam detection\n","- Sentiment analysis\n","- Document classification\n","- Medical diagnosis\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"I0KkFMs9Fl8b"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"id":"-8uwoyjnFgvp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739355808932,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":514,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad
