It provides tools for various tasks, including regression, classification, clustering, model selection, and dimensionality reduction. In this guide, we'll explore the `sklearn.neural_network` module, which implements the **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)** algorithm. MLP is a supervised learning algorithm that can solve both classification and regression problems.\n","\n","## What is MLP?\n","MLP, or **Multi-layer Perceptron**, is a type of neural network that learns a function by training on a dataset. Given a set of features and a target, it can approximate non-linear functions for classification or regression tasks. Unlike logistic regression, MLP includes one or more **hidden layers** between the input and output layers, enabling it to model complex, non-linear relationships.\n","\n","## MLPClassifier\n","Let's start by exploring the `MLPClassifier`, which is specifically designed for classification tasks."],"metadata":{"id":"DA3Yr56hXyRE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"ojKulYz5XWPZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739384145672,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":3785,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Husnain","userId":"06157149168527424812"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import seaborn as sns\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Load Titanic dataset\n","titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')\n","\n","# Preprocessing\n","# Dropping rows with missing 'age' and 'embarked' values for simplicity\n","titanic.dropna(subset=['age', 'embarked'], inplace=True)\n","\n","# Converting categorical variables to dummy variables\n","titanic = pd.get_dummies(titanic, columns=['sex', 'embarked', 'class', 'who', 'deck'], drop_first=True)\n","\n","# Selecting features and target\n","X = titanic.drop(['survived', 'alive', 'embark_town', 'adult_male', 'alone'], axis=1)\n","y = titanic['survived']\n","\n","# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Standardizing the data\n","scaler = StandardScaler()\n","X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n","X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)\n","\n","# Creating a simple neural network\n","mlp = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10,), max_iter=1000, random_state=42) # 1 hidden layer with 10 neurons\n","\n","# Training the model\n","mlp.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# Predicting the test set results\n","y_pred = mlp.predict(X_test)\n","\n","# Evaluating the model\n","accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n","print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"mFy6uciYX2Ey","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739384146586,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":917,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Husnain","userId":"06157149168527424812"}},"outputId":"58a3460b-95d6-4a13-8532-b147b5bb0d6f"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Accuracy: 0.8041958041958042\n"]}]}]}
